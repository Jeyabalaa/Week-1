# Week-1
This project develops a Generative AI-based predictive maintenance system for Electric Vehicles. Using sensor and operational data, the model (VAE + LSTM) simulates future failure patterns of components like batteries, motors, and controllers, enabling early fault detection, improved reliability, and optimized maintenance scheduling.

# 🚗 Generative AI for Predictive Maintenance in Electric Vehicles

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Develop a **Generative AI model** that can **predict and simulate possible future failure modes** of Electric Vehicle (EV) components such as the **battery, motor, and controller** by analyzing **sensor data** and **operational history**.  
The goal is to **enable proactive maintenance scheduling**, **reduce unexpected breakdowns**, and **improve the overall reliability and safety** of EV systems.
