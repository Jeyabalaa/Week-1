# Week-1
This project develops a Generative AI-based predictive maintenance system for Electric Vehicles. Using sensor and operational data, the model (VAE + LSTM) simulates future failure patterns of components like batteries, motors, and controllers, enabling early fault detection, improved reliability, and optimized maintenance scheduling.
